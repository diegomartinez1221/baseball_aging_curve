               not necessarily who the player will become. All the ages of 
               the peak salary are easily within the declining years of careers.
               Many contracts are back heavy, meaning salaries increase gradually
               each year of the contract, which is extremely inefficient seeing how 
               players decline in performance this late in their careers.
               The data I use for these plots goes back to 1950. It would be interesting to
               see if subsetting the data to the Moneyball era and recent years has an effect 
               on age of peak salary. Certainly with how the market has been over the past few offseasons,

ex_1<-p("As I have watched the last few Baseball Offseasons unfold, I have become extremely interested in the 
new trends Major League Baseball Teams have approached signing players. No longer are the best free agent 
bats being signed to the largest per year value contracts. Bryce Harper's $330 Million Dollar Contract has been 
lauded over for being the largest free agent contract in American Sports History; however, it is nothing compared 
to what he was projected to receive a few years earlier in the neighborhood of the $400 over 10 years. Yes, it may 
be the largest sum of salary contract, but when you look at the salary per year, which is roughly 25 million per 
year over 13 years, he is not even in the top 10 of per year value. It was rumored the Giants were in on Bryce Harper
offering around $40 million per year; however for a short period of time. In the current market we are seeing an interesting 
trade off between contract longevity and per year value. I believe this is due to player's aging curves. Player performance
and age are not a linear relationship; however, they tend to be curved, improving gradually until a certain age then a 
decline. MLB teams are willing to pay for a players prime, but in doing so they will also have to deal with overpaying for 
the player's eventual decline. Aging Curves and being able to predict a players future are becoming an increasing part of 
the game today. Through this project, I seek to better understand aging curves myself as well as help you.

of the game including offense, defense, and running to analyze performance curves. The goals for this project are to 
compare the improvement and eventual decline of all batters' careers dating back to 1950. I wil compare players across 
generations aging curves to show how the career paths of today's stars compare to legends of 
the past. I also compare players' position to see if different types of of players age differently.
Finally, I dig into salaries to see how salaries change as players age compared to their performance.")
